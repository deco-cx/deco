# [Deno Compose](https://denocompose.dev) — Open-Source Webflow alternative based on Deno, Tailwind and TypeScript.

> Deno Compose is the community-first way to build visually editable apps based on Deno

**deno-compose in an open-source full-stack web framework** that enables developers to accelerate the creation of websites significantly by leveraging pre-built UI components (Sections) and API integrations (Loaders and Actions) from a global community. These building blocks are interoperable: one's output can be another's input, based on their matching TypeScript types. 

With deno-compose you can:

* Craft modern web apps with a **visual configuration editor** for managing APIs, UIs and content — all in the same place. 
* Compose pre-built features from a **community-driven ecosystem of Apps,** with one-click installation.
* Evolve your Apps with **built-in realtime feature flags,** rolling out code or content to specific audiences.

For example, a Product Shelf UI component might depend on a `Product[]`. There are many ways to get a `Product[]`, such as fetching it from an ecommerce platform (like Shopify or VTEX) or a search optimization provider (like Algolia or Typesense). deno-compose will automatically suggest matching integrations based on the defined type from a wide range of available apps, and the developer can choose the one that best fits their needs. Building UIs now can be abstracted completely from their data integration. Code against a known-type, get tons of first-class integrations, ready-to-deploy. 

To try out the deno-compose visual editor, navigate to the [Playground](https://play.deco.cx), choose a template, and experience a simplified yet powerful way to build web apps.

## Key Features

* Shared Vocabulary: Define the type you need, and deno-compose auto-completes with multiple matching integrations from a global community of apps. It's TypeScript taken a step further, turning types into a shared vocabulary that powers your UI and API integrations.

* Pre-built Implementations: Speed up your development with ready-to-use Sections, Loaders, and Actions. A treasure trove of pre-built implementations awaits to be discovered and utilized in your projects.

* Community-Driven Ecosystem: Engage with a global community of developers on deco.hub. Share, discover, and collaborate to enrich the shared vocabulary that deno-compose thrives on.

* Simplified Development Workflow: Just define your types, and let deno-compose handle the rest. It streamlines the workflow from type definition to UI rendering and API integration.

* Interoperable: deno-compose facilitates seamless interaction between different apps and platforms. It’s about breaking down silos and fostering a more interconnected web development ecosystem.

## Why Deco

deno-compose aims to radically simplify web development — like it was in the 90s, but with all the modern good stuff baked in. We propose that this starts by elevating TypeScript into a globally shared vocabulary of types that bridge the gap between interfaces and APIs. The simplicity of defining a type and getting auto-completions with multiple matching integrations from a community of deno-compose apps is a game-changer for developer productivity — both human and AI. It's a shift towards a more collaborative and efficient web development paradigm, where the community's collective effort translates into individual project success. No more reinventing the wheel, no more silos, no more wasted time. Just focusing on customer needs, **getting the data from wherever you need,** when you need it, and **allowing everyone in the team to create and publish great content** with that data, safely.
