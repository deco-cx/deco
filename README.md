# deco — deno composable web framework by [deco.cx](https://www.deco.cx/en/dev)

Every business needs a **fast, reliable website** that empowers its brand. Every website needs a **powerful visual editor and configuration panel** that empowers business people to create and evolve their digital experiences without the need for developers to deploy changes.

**deco** is a new type of web framework that builds the admin UI for your web app, automatically, as you build it. It allows developers to create high-performance, edge-native web applications **that can be controlled via a powerful, visual admin UI with no extra effort.** 

Using **deco**, developers can define **Blocks**. They are built on top of [Deno](https://deno.land) to provide reusable, configurable "packaged capabilities" that can be composed together to create and deploy powerful web applications in minutes.

The **deco admin UI** itself is based on blocks, and can be extended and customized to fit your needs. This allows developers to compose their custom, bespoke digital experience admin UIs to serve their business users needs exactly. **With deco, you get everything you need, and nothing you don't.**

Get started with **deco** today, and build your next web app with the power of Deno composable building blocks and the ease of a visual admin UI. Create and deploy a site at https://deco.cx for free!

## How it works

**deco** allows developers to create `sections` (UI components), `loaders` (data fetchers), `pages` (composed of sections and loaders), and many other types of **blocks** that can then be **easily configured in a visual editor UI by anyone in the team** with realtime changes.

Besides pages, **deco** also lets teams manage **audiences, flags, experiments and campaigns** with an instant, global configuration management service optimized for the edge. Using `matcher` functions, configuration changes can be applied to any specific audience. Every change is instantly available to matched users, from gradual rollout of features, to A/B testing content, to targeting specific users with personalized content.

## Distribution

deco is available on https://deno.land/x/composable using git tags.
